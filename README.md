# Just Another Infrastructure Library [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/thaf807e5s5jybwe?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hoborg91/jail) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/hoborg91/jail/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/hoborg91/jail?branch=master)

This is a set of C# projects containing some infrastructure classes and extension methods I use frequently in my works.
I have decided to place it in a remote repository and make a NuGet package to be able to include it to every new project I need.
I do not suppose that someone else might find this usefull. But if yes, then use it like you want and like MIT license suggest.

Projects are being distributed as ordinary NuGet packages:
* [Jail](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jail/), 
* [Jail.Design](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jail.Design/), 
* [Jail.HelpersForTests](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jail.HelpersForTests/).

Formerly these packages were known as one package [Cil](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cil/).
One beatiful day its source code has been moved from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hoborg91/cil) to [GitHub](https://github.com/hoborg91/jail) and splitted into parts (each part for different purpose).
